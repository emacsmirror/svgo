SVG optimization within Emacs with SVGO

This package uses the Node utility https://github.com/svg/svgo[SVGO] to optimize SVG files. It provides a command and an optional minor mode to reduce the size of the SVG contents in the current Emacs buffer.

== Installation

To install this package you should use `use-package`, like so:

[source]
----
(use-package svgo
  :straight '(svgo :type git :host github :repo "hupf/svgo.el")
  :hook ((image-mode . svgo-mode)
         (nxml-mode . svgo-mode)))
----

Also make sure you have Node/NPM installed on your machine.

== Usage

image::svgo.gif[Demonstration of the svgo-mode]

After opening a SVG file in Emacs, you can toggle the image display with `C-c C-c`. Then either execute `M-x svgo` or with the `svgo-mode` minor mode configured you can press `C-c o` to optimize the file.

If the `svgo` NPM package is missing you will be prompted to automatically install it.
